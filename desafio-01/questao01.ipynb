two nights haue seene hor well sit we downe and let vs heare barnardo speake of this barn last night of all when yond same starre that westward from the pole had made his course t illume that part of

th ambitious norwey combatted so frown he once when in an angry parle he smot the sledded pollax on the ice is strange mar thus twice before and iust at this dead houre with martiall stalke hath he gone by our watch hor in what particular thought to work i know not but in the grosse and scope of my opinion this boades some strange erruption to our state mar good now sit downe tell me he that knowes why this same strict and most obseruant watch so nightly toyles the subiect of the land and why such dayly cast of brazon cannon and forraigne mart for implements of warre why such impresse of whose sore taske do not diuide the sunday from the weeke what might be toward that this sweaty hast doth make the night with the day who that can informe me hor that can i at least the whisper goes so our last king whose image euen but now appear to vs was as you know by fortinbras of norway thereto prick on by a most emulate pride dar to the combate in which our valiant hamlet for so this side of our knowne world esteem him did slay this fortinbras who by a seal compact well ratified by law and heraldrie did forfeite with his life all those his lands which he stood seiz on to the conqueror against the which a moity competent was gaged by our king which had to the inheritance of fortinbras had he bin vanquisher as by the same and carriage of the article designe his fell to hamlet now sir young fortinbras of vnimproued mettle hot and full hath in the skirts of norway heere and there shark vp a list of landlesse resolutes for foode and diet to some enterprize that hath a stomacke i which is no other and it doth well appeare vnto our state but to recouer of vs by strong hand and termes compulsatiue those foresaid lands so by his father lost and this i take it is the maine motiue

for it is as the ayre invulnerable and our vaine blowes malicious mockery barn it was about to speake when the cocke crew hor and then it started like a guilty thing vpon a fearfull summons i haue heard the cocke that is the trumpet to the day doth with his lofty and throate awake the god of day and at his warning whether in sea or fire in earth or ayre th extrauagant and erring spirit hyes to his confine and of the truth heerein this present obiect made probation mar it faded on the crowing of the cocke some sayes that euer that season comes wherein our sauiours birch is celebrated the bird of dawning singeth all night long and then they say no spirit can walke abroad the nights are wholsome then no planets strike no faiery talkes nor witch hath power to charme so hallow and so gracious is the time hor so haue i heard and do in part beleeue it but looke the morne in russet mantle clad walkes o the dew of yon high easterne hill breake we our watch vp and by my aduice let vs impart what we haue seene to night vnto yong hamlet for vpon my life this spirit dumbe to vs will speake to him do you consent we shall acquaint him with it as needfull in our loues fitting our duty mar let i pray and i this morning know where we shall finde him most conueniently exeunt scena secunda enter claudius king of denmarke gertrude the queene hamlet polonius laertes and his sister ophelia lords attendant king though yet of hamlet our deere brothers death the memory be greene and that it vs befitted to beare our hearts in greefe and our whole kingdome to be contracted in one brow of woe yet so farre hath discretion fought with nature that we with wisest sorrow thinke on him together with remembrance of our selues therefore our sometimes sister now our queene th imperiall ioyntresse of this warlike state haue we as with a defeated ioy with one auspicious and one dropping eye with mirth in funerall and with dirge in marriage in equall scale weighing delight and dole taken to wife nor haue we heerein your better wisedomes which haue freely gone with this affaire along for all our thankes now followes that you know young fortinbras holding a weake supposall of our worth or thinking by our late deere brothers death our state to be disioynt and out of frame colleagued with the dreame of his aduantage he hath not fayl to pester vs with message importing the surrender of those lands lost by his father with all bonds of law to our most valiant brother so much for him enter voltemand and cornelius now for our selfe and for this time of meeting thus much the businesse is we haue heere writ to norway vncle of young fortinbras who impotent and bedrid scarsely heares of this his nephewes purpose to suppresse his further gate heerein in that the leuies the lists and full proportions are all made out of his subiect and we heere dispatch you good cornelius and you voltemand for bearing of this greeting to old norway giuing to you no further personall power to businesse with the king more then the scope of these dilated articles allow farewell and let your hast commend your duty volt in that and all things will we shew our duty king we doubt it nothing heartily farewell exit voltemand and cornelius and now laertes what the newes with you you told vs of some suite what laertes you can not speake of reason to the dane and loose your voyce what thou beg laertes that shall not be my offer not thy asking the head is not more natiue to the heart the hand more instrumentall to the mouth then is the throne of denmarke to thy father what thou haue laertes laer dread my lord your leaue and fauour to returne to france from whence though willingly i came to denmarke to shew my duty in your coronation yet now i must confesse that duty done my thoughts and wishes bend againe towards france and bow them to your gracious leaue and pardon king haue you your fathers leaue what sayes pollonius pol he hath my lord i do beseech you giue him leaue to go king take thy faire houre laertes time be thine and thy best graces spend it at thy will but now my cosin hamlet and my sonne ham a little more then kin and lesse then kinde king how is it that the clouds still hang on you ham not so my lord i am too much sun queen good hamlet cast thy nightly colour off and let thine eye looke like a friend on denmarke do not for euer with thy veyled lids seeke for thy noble father in the dust thou is common all that liues must dye passing through nature to eternity ham i madam it is common queen if it be why seemes it so particular with thee ham seemes madam nay it is i know not seemes not alone my inky cloake good mother nor customary suites of solemne blacke nor windy suspiration of forc breath no nor the fruitfull riuer in the eye nor the deiected hauiour of the visage together with all formes moods shewes of griefe that can denote me truly these indeed seeme for they are actions that a man might play but i haue that within which passeth show these but the trappings and the suites of woe king is sweet and commendable in your nature hamlet to giue these mourning duties to your father but you must know your father lost a father that father lost lost his and the suruiuer bound in filiall obligation for some terme to do obsequious sorrow but to perseuer in obstinate condolement is a course of impious stubbornnesse is vnmanly greefe it shewes a will most incorrect to heauen a heart vnfortified a minde impatient an vnderstanding simple and vnschool for what we know must be and is as common as any the most vulgar thing to sence why should we in our peeuish opposition take it to heart fye is a fault to heauen a fault against the dead a fault to nature to reason most absurd whose common theame is death of fathers and who still hath cried from the first coarse till he that dyed to day this must be so we pray you throw to earth this vnpreuayling woe and thinke of vs as of a father for let the world take note you are the most immediate to our throne and with no lesse nobility of loue then that which deerest father beares his sonne do i impart towards you for your intent in going backe to schoole in wittenberg it is most retrograde to our desire and we beseech you bend you to remaine heere in the cheere and comfort of our eye our cheefest courtier cosin and our sonne qu let not thy mother lose her prayers hamlet
